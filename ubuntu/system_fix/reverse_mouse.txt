1. Open a terminal. Type:

2. Paste the following to the text file.

pointer = 1 2 3 5 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

You can see that the sequence 4 and 5 are switched. This represents the switch in the vertical scrolling direction. If you want the horizontal scrolling to switch as well, switch the 6 and 7.

3. Save the file with the name ‘.Xmodmap’ (without the quote, but with the dot in front) in your Home folder.

4. Close the file and terminal.

5. Log out and log in again. Your mouse scrolling direction should change now.

To revert the setting, simply delete/remove the .Xmodmap file.

If you are using KDE (Kubuntu), the tweak is slightly different.

1. Go to “System Setting -> Input Devices -> Mouse”.

2. Check the box “Reverse Scrolling Direction”. Click Apply.

naturalscrolling-kde

That’s it.

Note: There is another app call naturalscrolling. I have tried it in Ubuntu Oneiric beta and it doesn’t work. If you are keen to try it out, here is how you can install it:

Open a terminal and type:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zedtux/naturalscrolling
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install naturalscrolling

If everything goes well for you, you should see an appindicator where you can tick to change the mouse scrolling direction. Let me know how it works for you.
